RECOMMENDATION

I do not recommend using PHP for future development. Instead, use modern frameworks that offer better scalability, maintainability, and security.

========== Suggested Technologies ==========

Backend: Use frameworks such as Laravel (if sticking with PHP), Node.js or etc.

Frontend: Preferably use Angular, React, etc.

Database: Use MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB based on project needs.

Hosting & Deployment: Use platforms like AWS, Vercel, Firebase, or DigitalOcean for efficient deployment.



========== Development Best Practices ==========

Follow MVC or a well-structured architecture.

Ensure proper documentation and version control.
